# Book: Level Up #

I'm more than half-way through writing a new book for developers. It is a collection of 'cheat sheets' to level up your developer skills in all areas, including 'soft skills' and technical interviews. Each chapter gets straight to the point and explains everything in simple terms. So, 'Level Up' may seem shorter than some other developer-related books, but it is by far packed with a lot more useful information. I've made sure that there is a high signal-to-noise ratio for all readers and experience levels.

'Level Up' is the handbook that you want when looking for a refresher or learning something for the first time. All the basics are covered, and some of the more advanced topics also. Each chapter also contains a section with 'further resources' so that you can learn even more. Each extra resource has been personally checked out and used.

What's still left is gathering the 100s of technical blog posts/tutorials/walk-throughs I've made, updating the all the notes to a common format, and to re-read it all again to check for mistakes, updates, and maybe provide a good flow.

A few written chapters I don't have available for pre-release preview yet because the translation process from mediawiki to markdown didn't go so well. I'm sure there is a good converter out there so that I don't have to create one, but I haven't had time to find it yet. I will eventually add to the notes what I've already tried.



## Raw Thoughts ##

icon is LEVEL going "up", like a wuzzle/rebus. Though, it will look the same going down also. Might need an arrow or to show leveling-up to a value like 99.
