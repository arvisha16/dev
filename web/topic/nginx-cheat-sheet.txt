# Nginx Cheat Sheet #
(Pronounced "engine-x")


## Defaults ##
- Important server config files are located in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, `/etc/nginx/sites-avialable/`, `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`
- Public website files located at ``, though many times moved to `/var/www/<site-domain>/html/`


## Simple Snippets ##
- Restart server by running, `sudo service nginx restart` (may also be found at `/etc/init.d/nginx restart`)
- Or, run `nginx -s reload`


### How to SSH into server ###
This quick walkthough first explains how to add SSH public key to server so that you can log in without a password. After that is the simple `ssh` command.

For Linux/Mac:

    ssh-id-copy myusername@123.123.123.123

For Windows, using git-bash (or similar):

    // Not exactly this yet... Basically, paste contents of SSH pub to the other file on server from your home directory.
    scp C:\User\MyUserName\.ssh\.ssh_id.pub ~/MyUserName/.ssh/authorized_ids

Now, you can log in without a password

    ssh myusername@123.123.123.123
