## Train of Thought
- "It’s not how your app works that needs to be high-concept, it’s what problem your app is trying to solve." [source](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/build-a-product-with-a-high-concept-problem-c6d405cb1e89#.gx92mgtf5)
- Exercise: Write the ideal review for the app. Then, doc points for every time the company is mentioned. Only get points if person talks about self in first person language.
- Focus on the user:
    - - Make the USER awesome! Focus less on app/business/service awesomeness.
    - "People don't use the app because they like the app or like you, they use it because they like themselves."
    - "People don't tell their friends about your product because they like you. They tell their friends because they like their friends."
    - Instead of asking "How can I (app owner) get more likes?", possibly ask "How can I get users more likes on their blogs?", and possibly "how can I get my users to be more interesting at a dinner party?"
    - "Don't design so users are impressed with you. Design so others are impressed with users."
    - Forward Flow: Provide motivation to keep users making forward progress.
- Enclothed Cognition: Increase your IQ by what you wear. (Re: Experiment with white lab coats. One group was told it was a scientists coat, the other group was told it was for painters. Science group did better at engineering problems. The painter group did better at creative problems.)
- MVP (Minimal Viable Product): Some companies focus too much on the word 'Minimal' and don't have enough emphasis on the word 'Viable'.
- Running A Business: Spend money on things people will talk about (reason: free promotions/advertisements). And, make sure it never gets too degraded in looks. People should like visiting there, and working there. Maybe like living in a museum.
