# Business Cheat Sheet



## Basics

### Copywriting
Samples:
- "You are in the very small minority that hasn't paid your taxes yet"

[Copywriting that Converts: How to Sell Without Selling Your Soul](http://vimeo.com/71008640) (MicroConf 2013)
- Instill curiosity in writing, like a good story does.
- Use the "even-if" clause. Ex: "Get your screen fixed, even if it has been blown to smithereens."
- Don't include words referring to the company (e.g. "we", "our", "I"). Instead, talk about the user using "you", and sometimes "me" or "I" for a button/interaction.
- 3D: Repeat same thing three times, three different ways in order to get user to agree more with what you are writing.
- Use picture words.
- Use email like growth hackers
- Use long-form sales page strategy

Selling yourself in the right light:
- Scenario: Being a WordPress installer.
    - Okay: Makes websites for people.
    - Better: Online presence consultant that helps SMEs engage with their audience and thus increase their profit.

[Writing Microcopy](http://bokardo.com/archives/writing-microcopy/)
- "All of these microcopy examples have one thing in common: They help to alleviate concerns of would-be customers. They help to reduce commitment by speaking directly to the thoughts in people's heads."
- Examples:
    - "When people add their emails, say 'we hate spam as much as you do'"
    - "When selling a paid-for web application, be sure to let people know if you have a free trial."
    - "When storing customers' information, say 'You can export your information at any time'"
    - "If offering optional account creation, say 'If you create an account, you'll be able to track your package'"
    - "When signing up for a newsletter, say 'this is a low-volume newsletter'"
    - "When subscribing for something free, say 'you can always unsubscribe at any time'"

### Pricing

    - Simple is best. Make it easy to compare. Address FUDs (fear, uncertainty, doubt).

## Train of Thought
- "It’s not how your app works that needs to be high-concept, it’s what problem your app is trying to solve." [source](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/build-a-product-with-a-high-concept-problem-c6d405cb1e89#.gx92mgtf5)
- Exercise: Write the ideal review for the app. Then, doc points for every time the company is mentioned. Only get points if person talks about self in first person language.
- Focus on the user:
    - - Make the USER awesome! Focus less on app/business/service awesomeness.
    - "People don't use the app because they like the app or like you, they use it because they like themselves."
    - "People don't tell their friends about your product because they like you. They tell their friends because they like their friends."
    - Instead of asking "How can I (app owner) get more likes?", possibly ask "How can I get users more likes on their blogs?", and possibly "how can I get my users to be more interesting at a dinner party?"
    - "Don't design so users are impressed with you. Design so others are impressed with users."
    - Forward Flow: Provide motivation to keep users making forward progress.
- Enclothed Cognition: Increase your IQ by what you wear. (Re: Experiment with white lab coats. One group was told it was a scientists coat, the other group was told it was for painters. Science group did better at engineering problems. The painter group did better at creative problems.)
- MVP (Minimal Viable Product): Some companies focus too much on the word 'Minimal' and don't have enough emphasis on the word 'Viable'.
- Running A Business: Spend money on things people will talk about (reason: free promotions/advertisements). And, make sure it never gets too degraded in looks. People should like visiting there, and working there. Maybe like living in a museum.
