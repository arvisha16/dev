# BassBull #
A very simple baseball project for getting started with Haskell.

This project involves parsing a CSV file and adding up one of the stats. The main code has been put into a library `src/Bassbull.hs`, the main executable is `src/Main.hs`, and an executable for testing is `tests/Tests.hs`.
