- Address the following questions:
 - Who is going to use your app and what is their need?
 - How does your hack address that need? (this is where you demo your awesome hack)
 - How does the user acquire the solution? (if the monetization approach is clever, demo it here)
 - Is your hack unique? How is it unique?
 - Can the hack be scaled to be a viable business?


- Tell a story
    If you can, weave the points above into a story.   Here is how one team used a story to weave in a lot of points in short time:

    One speaker told a story about how his grandmother couldn’t respond to text messages even though she wanted to stay in touch more often (Question 1, time: 15 seconds). He showed the hack, demonstrating how their project removed the barriers that prevent the elderly from using technology (Question 2, time: 2 minutes). The speaker described the ways that grandma might come to own their product (Question 3, time: 20 seconds). 

    The only part of their message they didn’t weave into a story was their product’s differentiating factors and how they scale to be a viable business. Whether or not the judges agreed that this was the right solution for helping grandma doesn’t matter. We all remembered the story. We talked about the story. Stories work.
