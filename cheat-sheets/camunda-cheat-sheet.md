## Get Started via Docker
Great: https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/quick-start/

Summary:

**First time:**
1. Install Docker (if Mac: `brew install docker` and for GUI use `brew cask install docker`) and Java 8+
1. Run Docker and install the Camunda BPM Platform:
    - If Mac:
    
            docker pull camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest
            docker run -d --name camunda -p 8080:8080 camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest

1. Install the Camunda Modeler, see https://camunda.com/download/modeler
1. Run camunda-modeler


**Later times:**
1. Start Docker
1. Run: `docker run camunda/camunda-bpm-platform:latest`



## Basic Workflow
1. Start the local BPM engine, `nodeworker.js`
1. Update the workflow model via Camunda Modeler (BPMN, DMN)
1. In Camunda Modeler, save and deploy
1. Start a process



## Zeebe
A BPM similar to Camunda BPM, and made by Camunda, with more focus on scalability ('inifite' scale-out, [1M transactions/second](https://zeebe.io/blog/2018/06/benchmarking-zeebe-horizontal-scaling/)).

Zeebe supports BPMN and [YAML](https://docs.zeebe.io/yaml-workflows/index.html) workflows.

## Terminology

### BPMN
BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) is a standard for defining workflow (business process) automation models and executions.

[BPMN Quick Guide](https://www.bpmnquickguide.com/view-bpmn-quick-guide/)

### CMMN

### DMN
A decision table represents decision logic, consisting of inputs, outputs, and rules. The table in XML uses DMN (Decision Model and Notation) for the encoding.
