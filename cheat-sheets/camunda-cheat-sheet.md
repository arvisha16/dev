## Zeebe
A BPM similar to Camunda BPM, and made by Camunda, with more focus on scalability ('inifite' scale-out, [1M transactions/second](https://zeebe.io/blog/2018/06/benchmarking-zeebe-horizontal-scaling/)).

Zeebe supports BPMN and [YAML](https://docs.zeebe.io/yaml-workflows/index.html) workflows.
