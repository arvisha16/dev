### Storyboard

#### How to add a new constraint
1. Open the storyboard
2. Click 'Add New Constraints', which can be found at the bottom right of the storyboard, the second-from-the-right button

Notes:
- In the 'Add New Constraints' popup, even though there are numbers at the top, the drop-down option provides the ability to contraint to another view instead, but all view may not be available. You may have to add the contraint, the edit it later.
- To easily swap the first and second item, select the drop-down for either item, then click 'Reverse First And Second Item'
