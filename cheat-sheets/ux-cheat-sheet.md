# UX Cheat Sheet
UX (user experience) is not just UI (user interface). Some major parts of UX include:
- Copywriting
    - Also: Feature writing, requirement writing
- Emotional Design
- Interaction Design (information architecture)
    - Also: prototyping, usability, interface layout, interface design
- Research
    - Also: User research, field research, face-to-face interviewing, creation and administering of tests, gathering/organizing/presenting statistics, documentation of personas and findings, product design
- Graphic arts, visual design
- Taxonomy creation
- Other soft skills: presentation and speaking, working tightly with programmers, brainstorm coordination, company culture evangelism, communication to stakeholders

Fogg Behavior Model: https://www.behaviormodel.org/
- "Three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Trigger. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing."
- Simplicity: "The minimally satisfying solution at the lowest cost"; "Simplicity is not a characteristic of a product, but a perception of the user"; "Simplicity is a function of your scarcest resource at the moment"; "A task is perceived as simple if a person completes it with fewer resources than expected."
    - Time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, non-routine

[Behavior First, Design Second](http://bokardo.com/archives/behavior-first-design-second/)
- "You'll find that many successful social software products/services focus on the collection of social objects such as photos, bookmarks, friends, vampires. This is no accident... people collect things as a natural matter of course. Software that supports the behavior will naturally be more successful."
- "So as designers we can actually satisfy the collecting behavior at the same time we’re helping people get started with software. Do what MySpace did and give everyone at least one friend to start with (when you join MySpace you are automatically friends with Tom) Or, you can provide a sample post to let people know what a post is and how it works. Or, if you're building an activity stream why not seed it with a few items so that people know what that's like? It's kind of like giving people a place to sit when they move into a brand new home."
- "Some behaviors that drive us nuts are core to the human experience:"
    - We want attention.
    - We collect things.
    - We want status.
    - We are vain.
    - We make judgments accordingly.



# Progressive Reduction

    - 'Progressive Reduction' could mean simpler, friendlier apps
    - The first time user experience matter
    - If you see a splash screen, then the developer failed

    - Ask
        - What problem do you really hope [product name] will fix?
        - Is there anything else that [product name] needs in order to be invaluable for you?
        - Which competitor do you currently use?
        - Are you planning to continue using your existing product type as long as [product name] integrates with it?
        - How do you spend your days?
        - What's your email if you’re interested in early access?
    - Don't Ask
        - Here's this list of features we have in mind, go ahead and rank them or here's a list of features we have in mind, rank them all on a 1 to 10 basis.
        - Don't ask anything that takes anything more than a checkbox or a quick note.
        - You shouldn't be asking about you or your product. You should be asking about their preferences.


# Research Practices
## Do
- Make sure users are comfortable
    - "Hi, thank you for helping us!"
- Make sure reviewers know it's not their fault
    - "We're not testing you, we're testing the product."
    - "We need your honest feedback"
- Learning something from reviewer
    - "What did you mean by that?"
    - "Can you please clarify?"
- Use checkboxes. They are quick, easy, and efficient
    - Did user discover a certain feature?
- Know what you are trying to find out

## Don't Do
- Don't brag about your product
- Don't lead users/reviewers to an answer
- Never insult users/reviewers

## Afterwards
- What happened and what can we do about it?
    - What was good?
    - What can be improved?
- Write a summary so that everyone on the team can remember six months from now
- Make sure there are action items to do after meeting
- All team members should know what happened

[Kano Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model)

    - Conversion = Motivation - Friction
        - Conversion: What you want users to do. It's not just products sold.
        - Motivation: How much users want your product; Incentive.
        - Friction: How hard product is to get (usability, clutter, anxiety because of lack of info user wanted).
        - Conversion funnels can tell you problem areas. Compare across many many different things, including device type.

# Random notes
- "Many UX designers have started to re-label themselves as UX Architects, UX Engineers, or UX Strategists. Some have even dropped the word 'user' altogether and just go by Experience Architect/Engineer/Strategist."
