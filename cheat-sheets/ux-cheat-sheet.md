    - Also: prototyping, usability, interface layout, interface design
- Research
    - Also: User research, field research, face-to-face interviewing, creation and administering of tests, gathering/organizing/presenting statistics, documentation of personas and findings, product design

Fogg Behavior Model: https://www.behaviormodel.org/
- "Three elements must converge at the same moment for a behavior to occur: Motivation, Ability, and Trigger. When a behavior does not occur, at least one of those three elements is missing."
- Simplicity: "The minimally satisfying solution at the lowest cost"; "Simplicity is not a characteristic of a product, but a perception of the user"; "Simplicity is a function of your scarcest resource at the moment"; "A task is perceived as simple if a person completes it with fewer resources than expected."
    - Time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, non-routine

[http://bokardo.com/archives/behavior-first-design-second/ Behavior First, Design Second]
- "You'll find that many successful social software products/services focus on the collection of social objects such as photos, bookmarks, friends, vampires. This is no accident... people collect things as a natural matter of course. Software that supports the behavior will naturally be more successful."
- "So as designers we can actually satisfy the collecting behavior at the same time weâ€™re helping people get started with software. Do what MySpace did and give everyone at least one friend to start with (when you join MySpace you are automatically friends with Tom) Or, you can provide a sample post to let people know what a post is and how it works. Or, if you're building an activity stream why not seed it with a few items so that people know what that's like? It's kind of like giving people a place to sit when they move into a brand new home."
- "Some behaviors that drive us nuts are core to the human experience:"
    - We want attention.
    - We collect things.
    - We want status.
    - We are vain.
    - We make judgments accordingly.



# Random notes
- "Many UX designers have started to re-label themselves as UX Architects, UX Engineers, or UX Strategists. Some have even dropped the word 'user' altogether and just go by Experience Architect/Engineer/Strategist."
