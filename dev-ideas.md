## Ideas
- Find a new way for people to express themselves, then build services around it
- Use theme of at least one of the seven sins
- Combine two or more fields to make an entirely new one


### Less Useful
- Picsong: Convert any image into audio



### For learning
Potentially create just 'minimal' versions of the following ideas, or enough to publish as an open-source library.

- '10,000': Track hours until mastery
- Explore government data, maybe just pick one to show nicely

- Chat (link via person/people, link via url)
- Dog walker with real-time tracking
- Marketplace
- Restaurant management
- Shopping list
- Website (Blogger, Reddit, Stack Overflow, User Voice)



## Random Thoughts
- What's the minimal code needed to create a TODO app? Can I just only import libraries? Maybe theme libraries called material-red or material-0fffe5 for programmatic imports. Look at bootstrap components for ideas. Ability to mix and match UI layout and theme style and animation
    - Maybe a library called 'save and put to list' or 'save input to database'
    - Maybe a library called 'show input from database'
    - Maybe each view object should have a save-key or storage key. Inputs are automatically setters, and outputs are automatically getters. (this looks like 'data-binding')
- What is the simplest way to recreate websites for local restaurants? Many of them have a very similar format
- OS is an IDE
    - OS could already be thought of as a 'Do Everything IDE'.. everything just has bad integration and different themes
