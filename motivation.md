# Motivation for Developers (and more)

My TODO list always seems to be growing. So, new idea: For each TODO, estimate the time for completion and immediately do ones that take less than 5 minutes.


## Agility
1. Find out where you are
2. Take a small step towards your goal
3. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
4. Repeat

Tip: When faced with two of more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value, take the path that makes future change easier
