# How to Create a Mind by Ray Kurzweil #

Written in 2012.

It's a good book with many great examples. A large field of topics are covered.

Kurzweil uses thought experiments to show that the human brain is basically full of many redundant pattern recognizers (and some more things).


Here's some more high-level notes from reading:

- Much can be learned from thought experiments.
- PRTM - pattern recognition theory of the mind
- HHMM - hierarchical hidden Markov model
- LOAR - law of accelerating returns
- 'Some observers have argued that Watson does not really "understand" the Jeopardy queries ... because it is just engaging in "statistical analysis". ... mathematical very similar to the methods that biology evolved in the form of the neocortex. If understanding language and other phenomena through statistical analysis does not count as true understanding, then humans have no understanding either.' p7
- Metaphor about brain complexity to forest complexity. p9
- Experiment: Recite alphabet. Recite alphabet backwards. Recite SSN backwards. Recite song lyrics backwards. Computers can do this easily. The backwards sequence is a new series for our brain. This tells us something about how human memory is organized. "This suggests that our memory is sequential and in order. They can be accessed in the order that they are remembered. We are unable to directly reverse the sequence of a memory." p27
- "We also have some difficulty starting a memory in the middle of a sequence." Ex: playing music, recalling a walk. p28
- ... "This suggests that there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in our brains. Our memories are stored as sequences of patterns. Memories that are not accessed dim over time." p29
- "Our conscious experience of our perceptions is actually changed by our interpretations. ... This implies that we are constantly predicting the future and hypothesizing what we will experience. This expectations influences what we actually perceive. Predicting the future is actually the primary reason that we have a brain." p31
- "Each of our routine procedures are remembered as an elaborate hierarchy of nested activities." p33
- "The use of hierarchies allow us to reuse patterns." (composition) p33
- "Using an artificial hippocampus, the rates were able to quickly relearn the behavior... Flip it of and the rats forget..." Working alongside the rats' natural one, resulted in ability to learn new behaviors strengthened. p102
- "It is the job of our neocortex to enable us to be the master of pleasure and feat and not their slave." p105
- "In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them." - John von Neumann (p179)
- Some people consider consciousness to be the capacity for self-reflection, some describe it as ability to think about thinking. But, there could be issues with those definitions.. Is Watson (AI) conscious whereas the baby and dog are not? p200
- "If that is how we treat fictional nonbiological characters today, then that is how we will treat real-life intelligences in the future.." p211
- We shouldn't dismiss the concept of consciousness too easily. It underlies our moral system, and our legal system in turn. If a person extinguishes someone's consciousness, as in murder, ... p212
  - "If I destroy my property, it is probably acceptable. If I destroy your property without your permission, it is probably not acceptable, but not because I am causing suffering to your property, but rather to you as the owner of the property." And more good examples (animal property, abortion, ..). p212
- Young children don't pass the Turing test. p213
- "Nonetheless I will continue to act as if I have free will and to believe in it, so long as I don't have to explain why." p240
- "How do we arrive at on the order to 100 to 1,000 trillion connections in the brain from only tens of millions of bytes of design information? Obviously, the answer is through massive redundancy." p271



My side notes:

- If you can accurately model the universe, then you don't need to know anything. (when reading p158)
- In an AI Turing test, what if you ask 'Are you human?' (when reading p170)
- A good place to discretely test perfect AI could be in Amazon's Mechanical Turk ?
- Neural nets may already be on-par with human intelligence. The only reason we don't see that is because they don't get the same general training as us. For the topics they do get trained, they surpass raw human ability.
- [Transendence](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/) is a good related movie that comes to mind, using a human brain scan to jump start AI.
