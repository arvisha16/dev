You should read this book if you play sports and have ever wondered why you play good one day and bad the next. This book may help you have a more consistent and higher gameplay. Though, this isn't limited to just sports; This book is helpful for many activities where you have to trust yourself. Then again, I may have gone a little far with that last sentence.


## TLDR ##
- There is an inner game and outer game. There are already many great resources on the outer game.
- During practice, analyze your movements (methods includes "feeling" it, mirrors, video playback) and don't try to force any change. During game play, just let it happen naturally; trust yourself.
- Experiment with many different playing styles. The "right" style may be different for different people.
- You still may need some good outer game practice in order to gain more from these inner game tips.
- If you dislike competition, then you have the wrong idea about it.
- When playing, if you have any anxieties or frustrations, then you aren't a player of the inner game.
- The inner game is everywhere in life.


## Notes as I read ##

- "Every game is composed of two parts, an outer game and an inner game. The outer game is played against an external opponent to overcome external obstacles, and to reach an external goal. ... The inner game takes place in the mind of the player, and it is played against such obstacles as lapses in concentration, nervousness, self-doubt and self-condemnation.
- Example: Teacher was able to teach student by just showing and allowing student to visually copy.
- There are two "selves", and the key to a better inner game is to improve the relationship between the conscious tell, Self 1, and the natural capabilities of Self 2. Self 1 is the one that does the talking. Self 2 is the one that does the natural doing (Self 1 could do the "forced" moving).
- Example: Teacher was able to teach student by recommending that student just focus on seams of ball rather than focusing on making contact with the ball.
- Experiment: How long you can remain "thoughtless".
- If you keep telling yourself that you are bad at something, then you are going to start acting like it even more. You'd be better off learning to trust yourself.
- Example: Teacher was able to teach student by getting student to watch reflection, and getting to see and feel what they are doing.
- Example: When teacher complimented the student, the student's judgemental mind was engaged and then more focused on not doing bad rather than just doing. Negative nor positive thinking/compliments helped. The compliments were criticisms in disguise.
- By being non-judgemental (and non-biased), one can notice more.
- When Self 1 stops judging Self 2, a trust is developed, self-confidence.
- Think about all the things you naturally do well with Self 1 telling Self 2 how to do it, like sit in a chair, or walk. Other, "more complicated", skills can be done the same.
- Metaphor: A student learning a skill like a backhand in tennis. A small child learning how to walk without the mother being condescending to the child. Progress is achieved without harsh words. Imagine how other skills could be taught/learned the same way.
- Self 2 learns better and faster through imagery and feeling rather than words.
- Example: Teacher tells student to imagine the results that they would like to achieve. Then, don't actively try to get those results; just let it happen; just let Self 2 worry about how it is going to achieve those results.
- There is a difference between letting it happen and making it happen.
- Experiment 1: Place a can on the opposite side of the tennis court, and try hard to make sure you hit it on a serve. Notice everything and make corrections as necessary. Experiment 2: Place a can on the opposite side of the tennis court, and visualize exactly what your body needs to do to serve the ball to hit the can and play out the entire scenario in your head a few times. Then, when you serve for real, notice where the ball hits, but don't make any corrections. This will be hard to not let the Self 1 interfere, but you will be amazed on how Self 2 can work out by itself how to adjust without Self 1 trying or saying anything. And, don't judge self.
- When you practice, pay attention to what you are doing and what results from that. Experiment with each technique in many different ways until you find something that works for you (caveat: typically you want to use your entire body and not just one part of it).
- "Focus is not achieved by staring hard at something. It is not trying to force focus, nor does it mean thinking hard about something. Natural focus occurs when the mind is interested."
- Make sure you stay in the present, the here-and-now. You can do this multiple ways, but you only need to choose one area of focus, like your breathing, seeing the seams of the ball, or hearing the sounds of ball and rackets.
- Q: What's the worse that could happen? A: Lose horribly, then eventually things will go back to normal. Q: What's the best that could happen? A: Win spectacularly, then eventually things will go back to normal.
- Q: Regardless of the outcome, what do you really want in life?
- Is it possible to have a desire to win without the ego trip?
- What is the purpose of competition? What is your reasoning for taking part in competitions?
- Besides an ego trip from winning, another reason for competition is to better one's self, to pit one's self against a strong opponent to learn the current limitations of self and push past them. Competitors should each hope that the other does their best so that they can cooperate by both learning as much as possible.
- Many players find it mentally hard to play well near a victory, especially on the verge of an upset. One cause of the uptightness experienced at these times is based on the false notion about competition. It is needless sense of guilt when you think levels of respect change after winning or losing.
- Play to win every point, don't worry about winning or losing the match. It is more important to make sure that you are making the maximum effort (or Self 2, not Self 1) during every point because that's where the true value lies.
- Using the maximum effort to win each point will carry you past the problem of anxiety.
