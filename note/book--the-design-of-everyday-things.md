# The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman #
(Notes based on the revised and expanded edition, 2003.)

This book has been highly touted since its first edition a few decades ago. There's definitely some good information in there, but I was a little disappointed because not much of it was new to me. This is likely because I have done other design and UX (user experience) research and reading. According the book, much of that other stuff I have read comes from the books that the author has written. So, if you don't know much about design, then I definitely recommend this book.

One of the main themes of this book, throughout all the chapters, is that if somebody uses a product wrong or makes a mistake with it, then it is likely a design fault of the product.

Here's just a few of the more interesting things that I read. The book definitely goes into a lot more detail about each of these and more. This is not a summary.

- p14: **Affordances** determine what actions are possible. **Signifiers** communicate where the action should take place.
- p62: "It seems natural for people to blame their own misfortunes on the environment. It seems equally natual to blame other people's misfortunes on their personalities. Just the opposite attribute, by the way, is made when things go well. When things go right, people credit their own abilities and intelligence. The onlookers do the reverse. When they see things go well for someone else, they sometimes credit the environment, or luck."
- p64: "We need to remove the word failure from our vocabulary, replacing it instead with learning experience."
- p75: "Knowledge is both in the head and in the world". A few pages explaining this more, with examples.
- p113: Many things don't need instructions once there is a natual mapping between controls and actions. For example, most stovetops are arranged as a grid of 4. If the controls are in a straight line, then they need to be labelled, which control is for which burner. But, if the controls are arranged the same way as the burners, then no instructions of labels are needed for them.
- p118: Caveat: Some natual mappings can vary with culture. Example provided: To most of us, the future lies ahead and the past is behind us. Some cultures speak of the future as *back days* and often gesture behind them. Another example: "If time is displayed along a horizontal line, does it go from left to right or right to left? Either answer is correct because the choice is arbitrary." Though, the answer tends to align with the same direction of the culture's native language. Also, for some, "time moves relative to the environment based on the direction in which the sun rises and sets." (more explanation in book)
- p125: Kinds of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, logical.
- p170: Type types of error: slips and mistakes.
  - Slips happen more in skilled people because task is subconscious for them.
- Hindsight is easier than foresight. It's also easy to confuse common sense.
