Not all advances lie in the strict computer science area taught in computer courses or jobs. There are many fields outside of low-level algorithms that can be greatly benefited by programmers/developers. But, you'll first have to learn about them. That's why developers should have a hobby outside of computers and read non-computer-technical books occasionally.

To provide others with a few starting points here's a few books that I have read and taken notes for. This directory contain text files with the notes, not specially this readme.

Programmers also work with designers often (or need to design themselves) so it would make for easier communication by knowing a bit more about the other field.



## Books ##
(These mostly link to other places within this repository.)

### Dev ###

- "Effective Java": Simply, a must-read for any non-intro-level Java developer. You should already know most of the language vocabulary/jargon.
- "Java Concurrency In Practice": Don't know much about Java concurrency? Think `Thread` and `Runnable` is all there is? In fact, there is a huge library built into Java for dealing with concurrency: `java.util.concurrent`. Learn when to use what, and the trade-offs. Learn about it from the architects and core developers of the package with many great explanations and plenty of easily understandable example code.
- "[The Algorithm Design Manual](https://github.com/danialgoodwin/dev/tree/master/algorithms-and-data-structures)": Just a few high-level notes.
- "Android User Interface Design": Great for beginners looking to get started with Android development. It has a little more focus on the widgets that make up the UI, and a small chapter about creating custom views.


### Non-dev ###

- "[The Design of Everyday Things](https://github.com/danialgoodwin/dev/blob/master/note/book--the-design-of-everyday-things.md)": Only design-experts wouldn't need to read this book, and that's probably because they have already read it. Developers, if you have one design book to read (outside your platform-specifics), then this is the one to choose.
- "[The Inner Game of Tennis](https://github.com/danialgoodwin/dev/blob/master/note/book--the-inner-game-of-tennis.md)": This is a great read if you have played any sport and have ever wondered why you play good one day and bad the next. This book may help you have a more consistent and higher-level gameplay. Emphasis: *Any* sport, not just tennis.
- "Predictably Irrational - The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions" by Dan Ariely: Great read about psychology and lots of reasons why people do irrational things (#BehavioralEconomics). Save you time from scouring the internet for all these examples/experiments, which seem to be based from the experiments of Dan Ariely (et al.) anyways.
- "Our Toilets Are Not For Customers": Stories about good and bad customer service. Not a New York Times best seller like the others here, but it was a somewhat entertaining read to take a break from the more "technical" ones. Very fluid book, easy to read. It will likely give you some motivation for providing better customer service. [Author provides free PDF version on his website](http://www.floydcoates.com/toilet.html). I bought my version at a thrift store just because of the title. (TODO: Move my few notes from paper to pixels)
- "Freakonomics - The Hidden Side to Everything": I read the book a long time ago, now I still listen to their [Freakonomics Podcast](http://freakonomics.com/radio) occasionally.


## Motivation ##
My motivation for creating these book notes is that I like to quickly remember the main points of the books I've read without having to re-read them in their entirety. I've done this for many books that I've read, though typically on dead-tree-paper, and left as bookmarks.

Also, here's another great resource that I like for more notes on more books and my original inspiration: [http://sivers.org/book](http://sivers.org/book)
