Not all advances lie in the strict computer science area taught in computer courses or jobs. There are many fields outside of low-level algorithms that can be greatly benefited by programmers/developers. But, you'll first have to learn about them. That's why developers should have a hobby outside of computers and read non-technical books occasionally.

To provide others with a few starting points here's a few books that I have read and taken notes for. This directory contain text files with the notes, not specially this readme.

Programmers also work with designers often (or need to design themselves) so it would make for easier communication by knowing a bit more about the other field.



## Books ##

- [The Inner Game of Tennis](https://github.com/danialgoodwin/dev/blob/master/note/book--the-design-of-everyday-things.md): This is a great read if you have played any sport and have ever wondered why you play good one day and bad the next. This book may help you have a more consistent and higher-level gameplay.


## Motivation ##
My motivation for creating these book notes is that I like to quickly remember the main points of the books I've read without re-reading them in their entirety again. I've done this for many non-fiction books that I've read, though typically on dead-tree-paper.

Also, here's another great resource that I like for more notes on more books: [http://sivers.org/book](http://sivers.org/book)
