# Management



## General
- High performance (and job satisfaction) comes from empowering people and not micro-managing them
- Having a 'brag sheet' is good for the employee and manager



## Onboarding
The topics can be included in the meeting invite to make things more smooth.

Topics:
- Introduction, including background
- What do you think are the most important things we should be doing over the next year?
    - What will get in the way of us doing that?
- What's going well? (What should we make sure we don't change?)
- Is there anything you think I should know about? (good, bad, important, whatever)

New hires should know the following things, at least:
- what is expected
- social norms and process
- current WIP and context
- how often getting feedback
- who to ask



## Compensation review
- Should be separate from performance reviews
- Highly-valued employee salary should rise at least twice a year



## Performance review
- Yearly performance reviews are too spread apart. Yearly goals can be too long.
- Attributes to review:
    - Communication
    - Collaboration and teamwork
    - Creativity, problem-solving
    - Quality and accuracy of work
    - Attendance, punctuality and reliability
    - Achevement, performance, the ability to accomplish goals and meet deadlines
    - Improvement
    - Management ability
- One-on-ones should start weekly with new hires, then can transistion to fortnightly, then can transistion to once per month
    - What's going well in your role?
    - What challenges are you facing? Where are you stuck?
    - On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you? Why?
    - Provide one idea to help improve our product or service.
    - What are your top three priorities for next week?
- Quarterly goals
    - Should include a non-work-related item, if the employee is comfortable with that. Work-life balance is extremely important
    - Personal growth
    - Career growth
- Be honest. We can't improve without feedback
- End on a positive note

### Example: Responsibility as a coach

> Schneeberger remembered an intern who refused to accept her review because the ratings were not all "exceeds standards." 
> 
> "Her reason for the protest was that she tried really hard," he said. Knowing her boyfriend was a basketball player, Schneeberger asked the intern if his working hard at every practice automatically meant he should start, and she was quiet. 
> 
> "I pointed out that my job was the same as his coach – to help her get better so she could figuratively get off the bench and into the game as she embarked on her career. I needed to teach her how to get better – and I couldn't do that if she was already perfect."
