# Management



## General
- High performance (and job satisfaction) comes from empowering people and not micro-managing them
- Having a 'brag sheet' is good for the employee and manager



## Onboarding



## Compensation Review
- Should be separate from performance reviews
- Highly-valued employee salary should rise at least twice a year



## Performance Review
- Yearly performance reviews are too spread apart. Yearly goals can be too long.
- Attributes to review:
    - Communication
    - Collaboration and teamwork
    - Problem-solving
    - Quality and accuracy of work
    - Attendance, punctuality and reliability
    - The ability to accomplish goals and meet deadlines 
- One-on-ones should start weekly with new hires, then can transistion to fortnightly, then can transistion to once per month
    - What's going well in your role?
    - What challenges are you facing? Where are you stuck?
    - On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you? Why?
    - Provide one idea to help improve our product or service.
    - What are your top three priorities for next week?
- Quarterly goals
