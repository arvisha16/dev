## User Research ##
Aka, usability testing.

- [Google I/O 2014 - The design sprint: from Google Ventures to GoogleX (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWQUSiOZ0x8)
- [When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)

My summary:

- It can be useful
- Know your target demographics
- Don't lead the user
- Not everybody has the same idea of what 'usability' means (but, doesn't necessarily mean any of them are wrong)
- There are different aspects to it physical, psychological, ..
- You could bring users in, or go to them, or have silent/hidden monitoring
- There may be actual specifications for usability for impaired users (thresholds to pass)
- There tend to be exceptions to every rule
